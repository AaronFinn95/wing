# Welcome! :wave:

**Wing** is a new open-source, statically-typed, [cloud-oriented programming language]. 
It has [distributed computing primitives], a [resource system] that represents cloud services with their 2 different phases (configuration & runtime), and [other optimizations for cloud programming].

[![Same object - different interfaces](./logo/diff-interfaces.gif)](https://youtu.be/y7OGRC2f5gk)

While most programming languages think about computers as machines, in Wing, **_the cloud is the computer_**.
So like traditional languages abstract the computer, wing abstarcts the cloud to allow developers to work at a higher level of abstraction and choose the target cloud at compile time.
The compiler generates least privilege IAM policies based on intent, and other cloud mechanics.
**The compilation artifacts are JavaScript and Terraform** (with more provisioning engines on the way).
Wing's [compiler plugins] can be used to customize to the compilation output, such as infrastructure definitions.

By providing a built-in local simulator, and an observability & debugging [console], Wing aims to reduce cognitive load and context switching, enabling developers to stay in their creative flow.

Wing's creator is [Elad Ben-Israel], who is the creator of the [AWS CDK].

Sample wing code:

```js
bring cloud;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the bucket
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// Here we are able to interact with infra config of the bucket
bucket.stateful = true;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the function
new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  // This code runs later, on other machines, and interacts with the provisioned bucket
  // So the interface for the same bucket is now different
  bucket.put("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");
});
```

## Why a language? (and not an SDK or platform)
We believe that the cloud is a new kind of computer that requires a [new programming paradigm](https://docs.winglang.io/#what-is-a-cloud-oriented-language) to fully utilize it.

While it is possible to use this new paradigm with existing languages, we believe that a language that natively supports it will take it to the next level, in a way that is impossible to accomplish with existing ones.

Inflight functions and resources are a great example. We believe it is impossible to ensure this level of isolation and interaction semantics in existing languages through a library, or even through a compiler extension. We've seen some worthy efforts in projects like [Pulumi's Function Serialization](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/function-serialization/), [Punchcard](https://github.com/sam-goodwin/punchcard) and [Functionless](https://functionless.org/), and in all of these cases, there are either compromises in safety (e.g. it is possible to capture mutable objects) or in the programming model (e.g. type system is too complex).

With Wing we believe we can provide a very elgant solution for both.
As seen below, wing has phase modifiers that are understood by the language server, which allows it to suggest different completion options for the same object, based on the execution phase from which is it accessed.

As can be seen in the below section, creating a new language that is tailored to the cloud from the groud up also allows us to assemble a variety of features (some of which exist in other languages of course), that put together offer a delightful cloud development experience.

## What are the main features of wing that make it suitable for cloud development
1. [Cloud services](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/resources) are first-class citizens.
    - They have [phase modifiers](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#13-phase-modifiers) with different interfaces for config or runtime (preflight and inflight).
2. Higher level of cloud abstarction.
    - [Standard library](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/wingsdk-spec) that abstracts main cloud services.
    - Built-in dependency injection system that resolves services to specific clouds at compile time.
3. [Distributed computing primitives](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights).
    - [Default immutability](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2023/02/02/good-cognitive-friction#immutable-by-default).
    - [Implicit async](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#113-asynchronous-model), explicit deffer.
4. [compiler plugins](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) that can be used to customize to the compilation output, such as infrastructure definitions
5. [Javascript interoperability](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#5-interoperability)
6. Automatic generation of IAM policies and other cloud mechanics based on intent.
7. [Native JSON support](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type).
8. More in the [spec](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec).

## What does the development flow look like with wing
1. Write code that targets an abstract cloud.
2. Visualize, test, and interact with it using the Wing console and its instant hot reloading.
3. Compile to JS and Terraform, targeting the desired cloud and provisioning engine.
4. Deploy and manage with your existing tools.

## Is there a company behind wing / what is the business model
Monada inc. is leading the development of winglang.
The language and local sumulator will always be open-source and free and are planed to be donated to a foundation.
Monada's business model is planned around connecting the Wing console to production applications and charging for the enhanced management and observability experience it will provide.

## This is Alpha

Wing is in its very early stages of development and not recommended for
production use. Many features are still missing, and APIs will dramatically
evolve in the coming months. We are excited for anyone to take part in
influencing the direction of every part of this project.
