# Welcome to the Wing Language! :wave:

Introducing **Wing**, an open-source, statically-typed, [cloud-oriented programming language] that is ready to give your cloud development a lift üå©Ô∏è.
We're here to make your journey through the skies of the different cloud providers more enjoyable and productive üòé with [distributed computing primitives], [native support for cloud services], and many more [optimizations for cloud development] üöÄ.

[![Same object - different interfaces](./logo/diff-interfaces.gif)](https://youtu.be/y7OGRC2f5gk)

Designed by [Elad Ben-Israel](https://github.com/eladb), the mastermind behind the [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk), Wing aims to elevate your cloud development experience and help your ideas take flight! ü¶Ö

# What's so special about Wing? ü§î

## Cloud abstraction ‚òÅÔ∏è
Wing takes a unique approach to cloud development - instead of thinking about computers as individuals machines üíª, it treats the ***entire cloud as the computer*** ‚òÅÔ∏è.
By abstracting the cloud, Wing allows anyone building cloud applications to focus on their business logic and choose the target cloud at compile time.

Here's a taste of what Wing code looks like:

```js
bring cloud;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the bucket
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// Here we are able to interact with infra config of the bucket
bucket.stateful = true;

// An `inflight` represents code that runs later, on other machines,
// and can interact with any cloud resources
let hello_world = inflight () => {
  bucket.put("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");
};

// We can then deploy the inflight as a serverless function
// (or in the future as a long-running service, etc.)
new cloud.Function(hello_world);
```

> **Note** The Wing compiler uses a dependency injection mechanism to convert these abstract services into the configured ones for each target cloud. It is possible to create and use external libraries too, including import of any Terraform resource üîå.
```js
// This line imports the standard library.
bring cloud;

// We are instantiating an abstract bucket here.
// At compile time, it will be substituted by the configured implementation for the target cloud.
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();
```

## Compilation to Terraform and JavaScript üìö
The result? While your main code is written in Wing, the compilation artifacts are JavaScript and Terraform (with more provisioning engines on the way üöö), meaning Wing can fit seamlessly into your existing stack! üéØ

> **Note:** Wing's [compiler plugins] can be used to customize the compilation output. For example, make all buckets that are exposed to the internet encryptedüîí.

## Local simulation üè†
In addition, Wing provides a built-in local simulator, and an observability & debugging [console], making it easier for you to reduce cognitive load and context switching, enabling you to stay in your creative flow. üé®

[![Interacting with the app using the console](./logo/console.gif)](https://youtu.be/Gqn1hYPEwqg)

> **Note** Since the Wing compiler sees the entire application, including its infrastructure, it can also generate least privilege IAM policies based on intent and other cloud mechanics üîê.

```js
bring cloud;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the bucket.
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// This code runs at compile time to provision the function.
new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  // This code runs later, on other machines, and interacts with the provisioned bucket.
  // The compiler knows to generate the network topology and IAM policies needed for the function to be able to put
  // a file in the bucket. It also knows to capture the bucket at deployment time and pass the info that is needed
  // for the function to interact with it at runtime.
  bucket.put("hello.txt", "World!");
});
```

## Why choose Wing? üèÜ
Wing was built from the ground up to cater to cloud development, offering features that make it an ideal choice for building applications on AWS or other cloud providers.
Some of these features include:

* [Cloud services](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/resources) as first-class citizens.
* Higher level of cloud abstraction with a [standard library](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/wingsdk-spec).
* [Distributed computing primitives](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights).
* [Compiler plugins](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) for customization.
* [JavaScript interoperability](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#5-interoperability).
* Automatic generation of least provilege IAM policies and other cloud mechanics.
* [Native JSON](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type) and schema validation support.

## FAQ ‚ùì

### Why is this a language (and not a library or platform)? ü§î
We believe that the cloud is a new kind of computer that requires a [new programming paradigm](https://docs.winglang.io/#what-is-a-cloud-oriented-language) to fully utilize it.

While it is possible to use this new paradigm with existing languages, we believe that a language that natively supports it will take it to the next level, in a way that is impossible to accomplish with existing ones. üöÄ

`Inflight` functions and resources are a great example. We believe it is impossible to ensure this level of isolation and interaction semantics in existing languages through a library, or even through a compiler extension. We've seen some worthy efforts in projects like [Pulumi's Function Serialization](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/function-serialization/) and [Functionless](https://functionless.org/), and in all of these cases, there are either compromises in safety (e.g. it is possible to capture mutable objects) or in the programming model (e.g. type system is too complex).

With Wing, we believe we can provide a very elegant solution for both. üåü
As seen below, Wing has phase modifiers that are understood by the language server, which allows it to suggest different completion options for the same object, based on the execution phase from which is it accessed.

[![Same object - different interfaces](./logo/diff-interfaces.gif)](https://youtu.be/y7OGRC2f5gk)

As can be seen in the below section, creating a new language that is tailored to the cloud from the ground up also allows us to assemble a variety of features (some of which exist in other languages, of course) that, when put together, offer a delightful cloud development experience. üòç

<br/>

### What are the main features that make Wing tailored for cloud development? üåü
1. [Cloud services](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/resources) are first-class citizens.
    - They have [phase modifiers](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#13-phase-modifiers) with different interfaces for config or runtime (`preflight` and `inflight`).
2. Higher level of cloud abstraction.
    - [Standard library](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/wingsdk-spec) that abstracts main cloud services.
    - Built-in dependency injection system that resolves services to specific clouds at compile time.
3. [Distributed computing primitives](https://docs.winglang.io/concepts/inflights).
    - [Default immutability](https://docs.winglang.io/blog/2023/02/02/good-cognitive-friction#immutable-by-default).
    - [Implicit async](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#113-asynchronous-model), explicit defer.
4. [Compiler plugins](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/compiler-plugins) that can be used to customize the compilation output, such as infrastructure definitions.
5. [JavaScript interoperability](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#5-interoperability).
6. Automatic generation of IAM policies and other cloud mechanics based on intent. üéØ
7. [Native JSON support](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec#114-json-type).
8. More in the [spec](https://docs.winglang.io/reference/spec).

### What does the development flow look like with Wing? üõ†Ô∏è
1. Write code that targets an abstract cloud. ‚òÅÔ∏è
2. Visualize, test, and interact with it using the Wing console and its instant hot reloading.
3. Compile to JS and Terraform, targeting the desired cloud and provisioning engine. ‚öôÔ∏è
4. Deploy and manage with your existing tools. üöÄ

### Who created Wing? ü¶∏
While there are many developers [contributing](#contributors) to the project, it started with the vision of [Elad Ben-Israel], who is also the creator of the [AWS CDK].

### Is there a company behind Wing / what is the business model? üíº
[Monada](https://monada.co) is leading the development of Winglang.
The language and local simulator will always remain open-source and free to use, with plans to eventually contribute them to a dedicated foundation.
Monada's business model is planned around connecting the Wing console to production applications and charging for the enhanced management and observability experience it will provide. Use of the console for development will always remain free. üí°

By choosing this approach, Monada aligns its interests with those of the community, incentivizing itself to actively support the Wing ecosystem. As Wing usage increases, it creates a potential user base for the production console's monetizable management and observability features, which are reliant on the managed app's code being written in Wing.

Since Wing is compiled to Javascript and Terraform, developers will always be able to continue to use their existing management and observability solutions with it. We believe that because the Wing compiler sees the "entire picture" of the application, a management console that taps into that knowledge can offer very competitive features. As the compiler is open-source, other companies will be able to offer competing consoles with the same features.
