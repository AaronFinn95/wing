# Welcome! :wave:

**Wing** is a new open-source, statically-typed, [cloud-oriented programming language]. 
It has [distributed computing primitives], a [resource system] that represents cloud services with their 2 different phases (configuration & runtime), and [other optimizations for cloud programming].

[![Same object - different interfaces](./logo/diff-interfaces.gif)](https://youtu.be/y7OGRC2f5gk)

Wing compiles to JavaScript and Terraform (with more provisioning engines on the way).
The compiler generates least privilege IAM policies based on intent.

While most programming languages think about computers as machines, in Wing, **_the cloud is the computer_**.
So like traditional languages abstract the computer, wing abstarcts the cloud to allow developers to work at a higher level of abstraction and choose the target cloud at compile time.

[![Compile to different clouds](./logo/compile-diff-clouds.gif)](https://youtu.be/y7OGRC2f5gk)

By providing a built-in local simulator, and an observability & debugging console, Wing aims to reduce cognitive load and context switching, enabling developers to stay in their creative flow. 

Wing supports backend developers with advanced self-service capabilities to minimize dependency on DevOps, improve code quality and security, accelerate delivery, and easily move code between clouds and platforms. 



This means that wing has distributed computing primitives and it treats cloud services as first-class citizens.
We also have some 

Wing applications compile to Terraform and JavaScript that are ready to deploy
to your favorite cloud provider, and can also be tested in your local
environment using the [Wing Console]

```js
bring cloud;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the bucket
let bucket = new cloud.Bucket();

// Here we are able to interact with infra config of the bucket
bucket.stateful = true;

// This code runs at compile time to provision the function
new cloud.Function(inflight () => {
  // This code runs later, on other machines, and interacts with the provisioned bucket
  // So the interface for the same bucket is now different
  bucket.put("hello.txt", "Hello, World!");
});
```

## Why a language? (and not an SDK or platform)
We believe that the cloud is a new kind of computer that requires a [new programming paradigm](https://docs.winglang.io/#what-is-a-cloud-oriented-language) in order to fully utilize it.
This new paradigm needs a language that natively supports it in order to give the best development experience.

For example, 
unlike a regular computer, the cloud is a big distributed machine, and it needs strong distributed programming primitives to fully leverage the power of a distributed system. Wing's inflight functions serve that purpose in wing 

## What are the main features of wing that make it suitable for cloud development

## What does the development flow look like with wing

## Is there a company behind wing / what is the business model

## This is Alpha

Wing is in its very early stages of development and not recommended for
production use. Many features are still missing, and APIs will dramatically
evolve in the coming months. We are excited for anyone to take part in
influencing the direction of every part of this project.
